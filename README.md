Docker is an open-source platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications. [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/) states that "it helps developers build, share, run, and verify applications anywhere â€” without tedious environment configuration or management".

## Docker Concepts

There are several concepts that are crucial to grasp when it comes to learning Docker:

1. **Dockerfile**: A text file/doc that contains a series of instructions, dependencies, or commands to run on the command line to build and assemble an image.
2. **Image**: A derivative of the assembled Dockerfile, read-only templates, and executable files used to create containers.
3. **Container**: A standalone, standard, and executable unit of software that packages up code and its dependencies and contain everything needed to run an application.
4. **Docker Engine**: The main technology that enables containerization. It consists of Docker daemon, Docker client, and other components.
5. **Docker Hub**: A cloud-based repository/registry which enables users to store, share, and distribute Docker images - like Github.
